# What are factors?

R's representation of categorical variable. Consists of:

1. A set of values
2. An ordered set of valid levels

```{r}
eyes <- factor(c("blue", "green", "green"),
               levels = c("blue", "brown", "green"))
eyes

# Why care?

By default, `stringsAsFactors = TRUE` when you use `read.csv()`

It's easy to get tripped up by factors if you don't understand how they work...or even if you do

* `fct_infreq()`: reorder a factor by the frequency of values
* `fct_rev()`: reverse the order of factors
* `fct_relevel()`: change the order of a factor by hand
* `fct_collapse()`: collapse factor levels into manually defined groups
* `fct_lump()`: collapse the least/most frequent values of a factor into "other"
* `fct_reorder()`: reorder a factor by another variable

## Statistical tests that can be used when your response is categorical

1. Chi-square
2. Logistic regression
3. Multinomial logistic regression

---

class: middle, center

## Chi-square 

Tests whether there is a different between the expected and the observed frequencies of one or more categories. 

.small[
In other words, use it when your response and predictor are categorical
]

---

# Example: 

Are electric pokemons are more yellow than expected by chance?

.center[
![](img/pikachu.jpg)
]
---

.small[
```{r}
#create a table that has the frequency of colors to types of pokemons
chi_data <- table(pokemon$type_1,pokemon$color)
chi_data
```
]
---

```{r}
#run the chi-square test
chi_test <- chisq.test(chi_data)
chi_test
```

---

##### Let's plot the chi-square residuals and find out how type is associated with color
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
if(!require("ggpubr")) install.packages("ggpubr")
```

```{r}
res <- as.data.frame(chi_test$residuals)
ggpubr::ggballoonplot(res, size = "Freq",fill = "Freq")+
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "D")
```

# Logistic regression

A statistical test to study the relationship between a binary response and one or more continious predictors.

At the center of the logistic regression analysis is the task estimating the log odds of an event.

---

## Test assumptions

* The dependent variable should be dichotomous in nature
* There should be no outliers in the data
* here should be no high correlations (multicollinearity) among the predictors

---

## Important to remember

* _Logistic regression is sensative to overfitting_ - adding more predictors will alsways increase the varience explained, but too many predictors can create overfitting and reduces the generalizability of the model beyond your data

* _Logistic regresion has a pseudo R-square_ - report it with caution because Numerous pseudo-R-square tend to have many computational problems that cause them to be artificially high or low.
A solution: present the results of a goodness of fit test such as Hosmer-Lemeshow

---

# Example:

Does pokemon becomes legendary with the in increase in `speed`, `attack`, and `catch_rate` abilities?

---
.small[
```{r warning = FALSE}
mylogit <- glm(is_legendary ~ speed + attack + catch_rate, data = pokemon, family = "binomial")
summary(mylogit)
```
